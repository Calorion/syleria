## Welcome to the Syleria digital garden!
This may turn into a blog someday, but for now it’s just a convenient place to publish links, saved webpages, notes, and random thoughts.

Truth be told, I don’t know whether really want a published [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/); I think I want a blog. Indeed, I have [one](https://blog.syleria.net/). Well, [several](https://syleria.net). But I haven’t updated any of them in a long time because they need reworked in order to be functional. Also, back when I was blogging I was using [MacJournal](http://thoughts.blog.syleria.net/2005/01/me-blogging.html) as my journaling software, which has great support for uploading to blogs. But it’s never had a decent iOS app, and after [MacJournal for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macjournal-for-iphone/id357602069) ate much of a long blog entry I had composed, I gave up and finished switching to [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for journaling (after flirting with [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) and, until it died, [Springpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springpad)). Which meant I stopped blogging as well, because although Evernote does allow you to [easily publish notes on the Web](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053591694-Share-a-note-via-public-link), a feature I’ve [used](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s120/sh/b83e35b8-075a-4ffe-93e3-522b78be31ed/5c12582ac5154d8d1d2760796bc56de0) on occasion, it’s hardly a blogging function.

And so my blogs have languished, because it was too much work to get them back up to functioning well, and my blogging software (still MacJournal, whose Mac client continues to work fine) was no longer my primary journaling platform.

But a year or two ago, I started messing around with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), initially because [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/), an awesome new read-it-later app I’d been using, started supporting it as a way to sync notes and highlights out of the app. I strongly approve of having backups of my notes and thoughts, so I checked it out. It’s pretty good! It’s not yet really polished, and [I’m not the biggest fan](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-is-obsidian-more-than-a-wiki/2914/60?u=calion) of one of its core features—editing in Markdown instead of rich text[^1]—but it seems robust, actively developed, and highly functional and customizable. Plus, it’s free! And I’m intrigued by the “[linking your thinking](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x54XJrECvk&feature=share)” concept. This idea works very nicely with importing my notes and highlights from Matter, and gave me thoughts of a better way of doing something I’ve wanted, and tried, to do for a long time: Create an easily accessible database of all the quotes I’ve collected over the years. With Obsidian’s [transclusion](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks) feature, not to mention all that [Dataview](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview) can do, being able to import my book notes, article highlights, etc., and format them in such a way that all the relevant quotes magically appeared in an organized, searchable way very much interested me. And after they finally got a [mobile app](https://obsidian.md/mobile) (I do most of my leisure writing, etc. on an [iPad Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP762) nowadays), I started messing with it on a semi-regular basis. I even developed a [Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11156/) or [two](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12864/) to help myself and others use the mobile app more effectively (seriously, check out [Save to Obsidian](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11156/) if you use Obsidian on iOS/iPadOS).

And there it stood for a year or so, until recently, when Evernote itself started eating my data. On both iPhone and iPad, when I wrote a note and then switched out of the app, or put the device to sleep, I would come back to discover that the last few words I had written were missing. Then the same thing happened, except to several paragraphs. That was the final straw (after several previous [questionable](https://discussion.evernote.com/forums/topic/131353-where-is-the-local-mac-data-stored-in-evernote-mac-version-1037-now1043/?do=findComment&comment=591359) and [frustrating](https://discussion.evernote.com/forums/topic/131263-bring-back-searching-notes-in-spotlight-search-on-the-homescreen-and-lockscreen/) moves on Evernote’s part, an interface that has *always* been glitchy, plus basic features [still missing](https://discussion.evernote.com/forums/topic/52260-mac-find-and-replace/) after many years), and I decided that it was time to ditch Evernote and lean into Obsidian full force.

Of course none of the above explains the existence of this garden/blog/archive/whatever it is. Well, I’ve long been aware that Obsidian offered a [hosting service](https://obsidian.md/publish), but at $20/mo, that was far out of my price range for a personal blog. Then I stumbled upon a random [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/x4xd72/how_to_automate_putting_title_in_yaml_frontmatter/) that mentioned [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), a free way to host your Obsidian vault. But it was confusing and technical, and looked like it wasn’t as simple as publishing content from within the app. However, looking into that some more, I discovered [Digital Garden](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=digitalgarden), an Obsidian plugin whose documentation walks you through the entire process of setting up free hosting, and allows publishing any note in your vault by adding a tag to its frontmatter! Perfect.

So here I am, trying it out! Welcome! We’ll see what develops.



[^1]: A tiny [Markdown rant](https://www.adamhyde.net/whats-wrong-with-markdown/): Markdown is very useful for its intended purpose: Writing formatted text that at least sometimes has to be displayed as plain text. That's it. That's all. If you're writing something in plain text (like, say, a Facebook comment) and you'd like to use some formatting in it, Markdown is for you. But if you're writing in an environment that always understands Markdown and displays it prettily, and have access to keyboard commands like Cmd-I that inserts formatting codes, there's no reason to use Markdown. Use rich text. Or HTML. Yes, Markdown can be read everywhere, by any plain-text editor, and that's an advantage. But not enough to overcome its disadvantages. After all, plenty of things can parse HTML, too. What we *really* need is a universal cross-platform rich-text standard, and it's asinine that we still don't have one.
